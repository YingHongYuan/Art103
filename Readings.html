<h3>Q1. From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinoasaurs really look like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this effect our understanding of what Archeology is saying about them.</h3>
<p> We know dinosaurs through the papers of scientists and the paintings of paleontologists. To understand the evolution of dinosaurs, we need to observe the bones of each dinosaur. Each bone may be different according to its size, fat or thin. When depicting dinosaurs without giving them movement and expression, it makes them look sluggish. So what actions and expressions paleontologists gave dinosaurs influenced our understanding of dinosaurs.
</p>
<h3>Q2. The artist/archcologist John Conway who is doing interpretaions of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other disciplines and forms of studies use similer techniques that reminds you of this method or process. Please eloborate with your examples both written as well as images and links.</h3>
<p> John Conway combines the latest scientific result with his imagination based on the possibility of science，to do the research. John Conway's way of research reminds me of the word "Design Fiction."

<p>Aimee Mullins —— an American actor, model and athlete who She amputated her limbs from a young age and received prosthetic limbs to walk and move. Aimee did not as other amputees did because they could not overcome the pain caused by prosthetics choose to sit in a wheelchair. Instead, after using different prostheses, Almee developed better alternatives by looking for design flaws in prostheses. As the efforts of Aimee and Herr promoteD the progress of prosthetic limb, millions of people benefit from the efforts of Aimee and Herr. It is also because their efforts that have made the prosthetic limb design in the world improved comprehensively.
