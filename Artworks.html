<h2>#01:Roller Coaster</h2>
<p>Video installation art, April.30.2019 </p>
<img src="roller.png" alt="roller" width="800" height="345">
<div {text-align: justify;}>
<p>I try to incorporate wood material and new media material together to create installation art. I got the idea of Roller Coaster from one night while I was viewing my mobile video album, I found the video on my phone that I took on the roller coaster at Santa Monica Pier. Since Santa Monica is the first place I visit when I came to the United States, so it has a great memory for me, and the feeling of seating in the roller coaster just makes me relax. Thus, I want to do something that reminds me of this feeling of relaxation all the time. I first used bend wood to make a roller coaster shape. In this process, I learned that using bend wood is not that easy especially when I need to make a particular shape, not just bend it.  After the roller coaster shape was finished, I have to think that how to project the video on the narrow wood shape. Then one day, I suddenly found myself really stupid that why can't I project it on the wall? So, I use the video as the installation background. And then I take a picture of the roller coaster wood shape and used photoshop to draw the line and put some little cars on it to make a gif. In the end, I put the video and GIF together. The result of the project was amazed me that inspired me to explore more in the installation art-making. </P>
