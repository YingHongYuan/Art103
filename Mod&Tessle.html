  <p>In this project, my team members are Lee and Jacky. I made two different designs, one is independent, the other is one side can contact with my team members. We have negotiated to take the wave as the final "merge item" side, which makes our design convenient. Although at the beginning of this project, we had errors in size control because of our independent design, but later we solved this problem very well.</p>

<P>The first pattern is the shape of Chinese traditional folding fan after opening. In this project, it symbolizes the development of scholars, that is, culture. The second pattern is the shape of an ancient Chinese city gate, which is the entrance and exit of many ancient Chinese towns. In this project, it represents the construction of the city. The third pattern is the ancient Chinese copper plate, which is simply explained as money. In this project, it symbolizes money for purchase. The fourth pattern is Chinese lantern, a kind of festive paper lamp. Its appearance often implies people's progress. In this project, it represents population development. The last pattern is the teapot. The appearance of teapot always accompanies people to sit down and talk and drink. Therefore, it represents communication in this project.
